### Motivation
Brachial Plexus Injury (BPI) is one of the common condition in the country with high
number of motorbike. This symptom is caused by the injury of brachial plexus network 
leading to the weakness or loss of movement in the shoulder, arm or hand.

Patients are mostly between 20-40 years old, who suddenly lost their jobs, and may 
become a burden of their family. One of the solution is to innovate a device which can 
move their hand and let them use in daily lives. However, the device must be mobile and
affordable enough for some patients. 


### Goal
1.The device gives patients the grasp movement to hold objects.

2.The device must be portable by patients.

3.The overall cost of manufacturing must be acceptable.
 

### Result
The glove with differential string mechanism can control a hand grasping movement which can hold 2 kg object tightly. 

It is portable with mobile transmission with the size of 3"*3"*5", approximately.

The transmission box was 3d-printed yielding the low cost manufacturing price.


### Improvement
Some additional movement should be provided for patients with more than one of uncontrallable parts of body.
To reach the standard of medical instruments, some topics are still needed to inspect and improve.
The standard in manufacturing must be consistent expecially for glove part such as the path of needles,
