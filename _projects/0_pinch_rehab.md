## Overview
Some stroke sufferers are restricted to perform hand movement in activities in daily lives. 
One of themovements is a tip pinch. This research aims to design and develop a simple mechanism 
for pinch movement rehabilitation. The device has one degree of freedom that couples the motion 
between the index and thumb joints. Theactuated joint is driven by a dc motor with a round cable 
transmission system. The mechanism aims to adapt with regular hand sizes based on the average distance 
according to boneâ€™s length literatures. The coupling transmission ratio between 2 joints is calculated 
to ensure a proper motion for a pulp contact. The prototype was developed and
tested by subjects. The average force for pinch action is about 1.6 N.
